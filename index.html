            <h1>Havant Park <sup>&trade;</sup></h1>
            <h2>We partner with early stage technology companies through capital investment to help achieve amazing things</h2>
            <p>Havant Park was founded to primarily invest with founders from under-represented backgrounds. We invest up to Â£250,000 in pre-seed and seed stage companies. We focus on investing in great founders with great ideas, not in which vertical they happen to operate in.</p>
            <p>Based in London, Havant Park is led by <a href="https://joe8bit.com">Joe Pettersson</a>, an active member of the European technology and venture capital communities.</p>
            <p>Beyond investing, we offer <em>free</em> advice on product, technology and fundraising to founders from under-represented groups in technology.</p>
